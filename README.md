You start choosing a game species, human, jared or technicians.
Explore many star systems.
Change and power up your spaceship and fleet.

The game is meant to give to the player the feeling of starting with an already powerful and well equipped space fighter, a ship with very advanced weapons.

Exploring other systems, in a free roaming fashion, the player is challenged with optional missions, which can be collected docking with planets or stations.

When docking with planets, stations or moons the player can find different spaceships, outfits, weapons or utilities for the spaceships in the fleet.
