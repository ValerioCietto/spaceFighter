Game inspired by Endless Sky and Starfighter
https://valeriocietto.github.io/spaceFighter/

You start choosing a game species, human, jared or technicians.
Explore many star systems.
Change and power up your spaceship and fleet.

The game is meant to give to the player the feeling of starting with an already powerful and well equipped space fighter, a ship with very advanced weapons.

Exploring other systems, in a free roaming fashion, the player is challenged with optional missions, which can be collected docking with planets or stations.

When docking with planets, stations or moons the player can find different spaceships, outfits, weapons or software for the spaceships in the fleet.

Spaceships
From a small fighter to a Capital ship, the player can operate any kind of ship. Some spaceships have special built in capabilities.

Outfits
Types are shield generators, power systems, hull nano bots, hyperjump drive, fuel pods, scanners, AI systems, stat changers, engines, decoys, jammers, stealth.

Weapons
Guns, fire straight or with auto aim, require usually input from AI or player.
Turrets, guns that auto rotate toward nearest target enemy.
Spinal, special guns weapons that are to be fitted to very big spaceships
Drones, small deployable spaceships without hyperdrive and autonomous behaviour
Fighters, small deployable spaceships that fly in formation with deployer ship

Software
Avionics systems that allow the spaceship to do standard manouvers given an hotkey press or button press.
Built in software allows for standard operations, but combat pilots may like to have the weapons to change toward the best one considering range and damage, or a missile with appropriate speed to catch-up with target.
Merchant pilots may like automations to establish trade routes, with auto docking, auto buy cheapest stocks and then take off to a target system.
